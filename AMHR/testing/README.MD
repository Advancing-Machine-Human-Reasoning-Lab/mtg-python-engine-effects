# AMHR/testing

**add_cards_to_game.py** will add cards to the game, and run the necessary tests along with the parser. There's a function to create decks and we can create as many as needed. There has been changes made to **game.py** to accomodate all decks in *data/decks* as opposed to creating 2 decks from *deck1.txt* as it did previously.

Also the script can be used to count the number of cards that have been automated already. It's just a matter of adding those cards to the **totalcards.txt** file as they are automated.

**cards_not_in_json.txt**: Changes have been made to **cards.py**, so that the cards that fail to be added in the game (for not being present in *parser/data/AllSets.json*) are thus appended into this textfile - and one can then include them in the json file.

Since there are numerous cards in **AllSets.json**, the game creator decided to add **parser/cube_card_list.txt**, which works as a list of cards that the parser acknowledges and adds to **cube_cards.py**. The name of the new cards that we add to the game need to be added to this list too, and there's a function that does so already. I have created **parser/m15_card_list.txt** but have not worked on it yet.
